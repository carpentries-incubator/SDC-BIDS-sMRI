**Thanks for contributing to The Carpentries Incubator!**
This repository provides a blank starting point for lessons to be developed here.

A member of the [Carpentries Curriculum Team](https://carpentries.org/team/)
will work with you to get your lesson listed on the
[Community Developed Lessons page][community-lessons]
and make sure you have everything you need to begin developing your new lesson.

## What to do next

Before you begin developing your new lesson,
here are a few things we recommend you do:

* [ ] Decide on a title for your new lesson!
  Once you've chosen a new title, you can set the value for `lesson_title`
  in [`_config.yml`](_config.yml)
* [ ] Add the URL to your built lesson pages to the repository description\*
* [ ] Fill in the fields marked `FIXME` in:
  * this README
  * [`_config.yml`](_config.yml)
* [ ] If you're going to be developing lesson material for the first time
  according to our design principles,
  consider reading the [Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh]
* [ ] Consult the [Lesson Example][lesson-example] website to find out more about
  working with the lesson template
* [ ] If you are planning to write your lesson in RMarkdown,
  [create a `main` branch and set this as the default branch in your repository settings][change-default-branch]
* [ ] Update this README with relevant information about your lesson
  and delete this section


\* To set the URL on GitHub, click the gear wheel button next to **About**
on the right of the repository landing page.
The lesson URL structure is **https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/<repository-slug\>**:
a repository at https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/new-lesson/ will have pages at
the lesson URL https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/new-lesson/.
