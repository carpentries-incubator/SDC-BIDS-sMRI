The PIOP2 dataset is part of the Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC), a collection of multimodal (3T) MRI datasets including structural (T1-weighted), diffusion-weighted, and (resting-state and task-based) functional BOLD MRI data, as well as detailed demographics and psychometric variables from a large set of healthy participants.
This dataset contains both raw and preprocessed data (and other "derivatives"), which is available on [Openneuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002790).

The contents of this dataset are described in detail in [this preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.155317v1). More general information about the AOMIC datasets, including instructions on how to download (parts of) it, check out the [AOMIC website](https://nilab-uva.github.io/AOMIC.github.io/).
